  Message: I'm sure you don't quite recognize me anymore. I've returned to join you
    and help you build this settlement. I needed to return home. Will you take me
    back? I've seen the Void and its horrors. You need my help.
  Response:
  - Of course! We had almost given up hope that you were still alive!
  - How can we trust you? How are we to know you won't just kidnap another child?
    Leave us. Leave this place!
