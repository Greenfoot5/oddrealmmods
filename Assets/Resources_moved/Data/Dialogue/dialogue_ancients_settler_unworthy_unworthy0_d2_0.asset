  Message: Could it be? Fellow Ancients? What has it been? One hundred? Two hundred
    years since I last saw one of my own kind? I beseech you to let me join your
    cause. If not for me, for the bond of kinship which binds our people.
  Response:
  - You Unworthy dogs are like a parasite. How dare you pretend to be one of us when
    clearly you are ill-intentioned, playing the part of a fool. Begone before we
    smite you from existence
  - Your words speak truth. So be it. Join us and together we will take back this
    world and the next.
