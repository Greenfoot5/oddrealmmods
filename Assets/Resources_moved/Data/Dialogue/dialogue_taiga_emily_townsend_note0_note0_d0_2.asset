  Message: Can't say I didn't warn you about the kidnappers. Although, it's really
    not as bad as you think. I'm part of something much grander than yourselves--an
    organization of warriors duty-bound to protect the innocent and keep the Void
    from claiming this land. {fn#entity_townsend_kidnapped_child0} has agreed to
    join our ranks and be trained in the martial ways. I give you my word that I
    will keep them safe.
